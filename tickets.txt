=== Ticket 1

@brief:
Setup noVNC server, since it seems to have better performance than conventional VNC.

@status: INPROGRESS

@date:
- created on 2025-05-07

@details:
When working with HiDPI displays, modern browser usually handles scaling better than VNC clients, that is why noVNC is preferred.

=== Ticket 4

@brief:
Make this repo. functional as a VS Code dev container.

@status: DONE

@date:

@details:
Making this repo. functional as a VS Code dev container would be more useful for practical development.
VS Code devcontainer has added bonus of git credential forwarding, ssh agent forwarding, gpg agent forwarding which are useful for development.

According to GPT:
> The discrepancy in the GPG agent socket path between a regular Ubuntu installation and Ubuntu running in Docker is due to differences in the *XDG runtime directory environment*, which is governed by the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable.

On modern Linux systems (like desktop Ubuntu), the login manager (systemd, lightdm, etc.) creates a runtime directory for each user at `/run/user/<uid>`. This is pointed to by the environment variable `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
However, in a Docker container, there is usually no login manager, and the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` variable is not set, which leads the GPG agent falling back to `/home/ubuntu/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent` (note `ubuntu` is the default non-root user in Ubuntu based container).

Manually creating the directory and setting the environment variable in the Dockerfile should is crucial for gpg agent forwarding to work in the container.
